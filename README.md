# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: Evangelin.S
RegisterNumber: 21500561 
*/
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",a**b)
```

## Output:
![exponentiation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94219798/149744121-8a0b06d5-59dc-4345-ba1a-020eb4aa38ae.JPG)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
